                    <p>
                        MattHL is a personal homelab project where I am learning to present web services and develop pages.
                        As my name is Matt, the name MattHL was a short and simple abbreviation I decided to use.

                        I'm Matt! I'm a software consultant in the Microsoft CRM space. 
                        I've spent a few years now using the Power Platform, and over time seeing Azure has made me want to learn more about cloud infrastructure and hosting services.
                        That interest prompted me to build this home lab project! If you're seeing this page, it is very likely being served to you from a computer sitting in my apartment.
